NotiChart is a simple beginner-level project I am working on that will serve as a personal home page that will alert me of notifications of websites I view often and to show personal notes I have created

TODO

( ) Add page to store due notes and calendar events
( ) Possibly rework the Calendar to look like a traditional calendar
( ) Create separate page to add calendar events
( ) Add option to delete calendar events
(x) Add option to delete notes
